*Answer the following questions in regards to the student's project you are reviewing. Include code snippets in your answers when relevant.*


### Are you able to produce any errors or unexpected results?
Nope, everything worked fine!

### Referencing the course nots on [Form design flow](https://hesweb.dev/e2/notes#/php/form-flow), describe the form design flow used in this project.
The design used is Design C, which is ideal when you want to display updated results on the screen. Correct design was used.

### Are there any separation of concern issues (i.e. non-display specific logic in view files, display code in controller files)?
Everything looks good.

### Are there aspects of the code that you feel were not self-evident and would benefit from comments?
This is hard to evaluate because my code is almost the exact same. The game is pretty straightforward and the code is simple, so I'm not sure comments are really necessary. Although, they always help.

### List any/all built-in PHP methods used with a brief summary of what the method does
rand - Returns a random number between the two number parameters provided.
session_start - Starts a session that allows values to be used in multiple code files.
strcmp - Compares the values of two strings.
header - Raw HTTP header.

### Are there any parts of the code that you found interesting or taught you something new?
No. Code was very similar to what I used for my game.

### Are there any parts of the code that you don't understand?
No.

### Are there any best practices discussed in course material that you feel were not addressed in the code?
No, I thought it looked good. Code is easy to read with whitespace and tabbing.

### Do you have any additional comments not covered in the above questions?
