## Game planning
Rock Paper Scissors
This is a two-player game where each player chooses one of the three options to "throw".
Scissors beats Paper, Paper beats Rock, Rock beats Scissors
If both players throw the same option, it is a tie.
You can play as many rounds as you want, but in this online version of the game,
we will play best two out of three.
