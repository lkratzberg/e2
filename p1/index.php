	<p>Hi! My name is Lyndsey Kratzberg and I am pursuing a Graduate Certificate in Programming. I am 
	currently a high school computer science teacher. The classes I teach are dual credit at the local community college, 
	which requires me to further my education with graduate credit hours. My background is in Accounting, 
	not programming, and I spent 11 years in the corporate business world before transitioning to teaching 
	a couple of years ago. I absolutely love the career change and love learning what I can do with programming.</p>
